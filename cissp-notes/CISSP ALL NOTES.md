**Confidentiality**
![[Pasted image 20240903233454.png]]
--> Nowadays,  it's hard to break encryption unless there's a side-channel attack possibility.
--> Need-to-know (You only have access on what you need to know, don't give too much access or information)

**Integrity**
![[Pasted image 20240903234107.png]]
--> Integrity and Confidentiality are closely tied. If one weak, the other is also weak.
	- Even if we keep our data confidential but unauthorized people can change it, well it's not a viable data anymore.
	- If we have a great integrity but the confidentiality is breached, well the integrity might not matter either.
